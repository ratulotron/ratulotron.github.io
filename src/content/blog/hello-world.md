Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my newly redesigned personal site.

## Why I'm Writing

I've been thinking about creating a space to share my thoughts on:

- **Data Engineering**: Lessons learned building ETL pipelines and working with data at scale
- **Python**: Tips, tricks, and patterns I've discovered
- **Life in Tech**: Navigating career growth, learning, and building things

## What to Expect

I'm planning to write about:

1. Technical deep-dives on data engineering problems
2. Quick tips and code snippets that save time
3. Reflections on career growth and learning
4. Whatever else I find interesting

## Let's Build Together
