              I am a Bangladeshi software crafter currently living in Berlin, Germany. Over the past 4 years he had
              explored different facets of software development. At the moment he is focused on building data solutions
              and bridging product development with data science.

              Minhaz, or less known as his birth name Minhazur Rahman, was born and raised in Dhaka,
              Bangladesh.
              As a curious kid,
              along with his brother he used to break and rebuild all their toys. Eventually in high school
              when
              he stumbled upon a
              C++ book, he found his new hobby of building software. It was a no brainer for him to get into a
              computer science
              program for undergrad, however the initial kickback from hardcore CS theoretical courses took of
              a
              few notches off of
              his excitement. He found inspiration once again when he joined the local chapter of Mozilla
              Foundation and did community
              engagement for Student Ambassadors and Firefox OS Dev programs for couple of years. He started
              using
              Ratul Minhaz as his
              community persona during the talks he took, as a combination of his nick name and first name. He
              joined a marketing
              agency as a web developer during his third year at the university and started his career as a
              software crafter. After
              working on full stack projects for a while his concentrated on backend development only, making
              Python and Django his
              main choice of tools. He considers himself a life long learner and loves to explore product
              development as an art method
              rather than being stuck with one specific area only.
