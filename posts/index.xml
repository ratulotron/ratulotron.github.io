You might say that is the sound of your blood pulsating in your body, recycling carbon dioxide and bringing in new oxygen every now and then.
To me is is the sound of wind passing by us, as we fall through the eternal void.

You might say that is the sound of your blood pulsating in your body, recycling carbon dioxide and bringing in new oxygen every now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me is is the sound of wind passing by us, as we fall through the eternal void. It is a reminder of that inevitable crash we all have to face when this brief flight we have been in since our birth ends and we stop moving forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you first realize this you can throw your arms outwards and cry in fear, you can try to clutch on to anything you can grab a hold of. Suddenly there is something in your extended fists! Another hand is clutching on to yours! The vibration of the wind rushing to meet you from below feel ecstatic almost. You were going to brace yourself for the entirety of this journey towards sure obliteration, but now you have someone to occupy your mind instead of those thoughts. Whenever you look right over your shoulder, there is that person smiling back at you like bright red petunia. You feel like it&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, may be this is what was meant to be, may be we were doomed to meet the ground with someone holding our hands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You look outwards and see the ones without a hand to grab on to. Something breaks inside you. The wind grows stronger, but you feel like you need to hold that person&amp;rsquo;s hands. You stretch out to them and surprisingly see the other hand, the hand that gave you the warmth in the first place loosens up a bit. You cannot ignore your instinct of flying towards the other body falling with all it&amp;rsquo;s weight centered in it&amp;rsquo;s heart. It&amp;rsquo;s a very heavy one indeed, and you feel like you need to lend some help to carry it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other body drops as if it&amp;rsquo;s bound to a rock, you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get a hold of it. Your heart bleeds each time you try to nudge yourself a bit towards it, but just want to give it some warmth, that&amp;rsquo;s all it needs, right? The warmth you got changed the fall for you, to you it&amp;rsquo;s not the fall that worries you anymore, you are more anxious how to fly in the sky rest of the way! You almost grab the other person by their collar. You close your eyes as you embrace them for one warm and fuzzy hug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wind grows colder. What is the end of this fall, anyway? Will it be a big splash? Or a thunderous kapoot! Will you remember the sound when it all ends and you are lying on the floor, looking up towards the gold-blue afternoon sky? You can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything with the anticipation of impending conjuncture. But oh? You wave your hands at nothing! You open your eyes and suddenly discover you have flown off far away. The heavy hearted one is still falling, you haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to give them the purpose to fly, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t show them the dream of the avian marvels of the prehistoric era. Instead you are so far away from those set of warm hands that gave you this newfound joy in meeting your crash, that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to get back to it. One single snowflake lands on your fingertip, the freeze starting to spread&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing you see before your eyes turn into crystal orbs of ice is those two pair of hands, the ones that held on to you when you were alone in despair. You have lost the amicable ardor that you were so fond of. You don&amp;rsquo;t hear the sound your body makes when it meets the concrete street and breaks into a thousand piece, you are gone way before.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Setting up Ember CLI Sass</title><link>/posts/2017-01-27-setup-ember-cli-sass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2017-01-27-setup-ember-cli-sass/</guid><description>Trying to set up Sass with Ember can be quiet problematic if you are using a version manager for Node.

These are only the simplest examples of opinion related questions that arise in our minds every single day.</description><content>&lt;p>How often do you get the urge to know what others think about you, that is, your actions and preferences? No matter what the number is, you are not alone. Humans as individuals, have always been interested in knowing the opinion of the people around them. Should I talk to her? Is it a good idea to buy that car? Who should I vote? These are only the simplest examples of opinion related questions that arise in our minds every single day. Getting a nod from your best friend, a positive gesture from your dad or a better campaign slogan helps a lot to answer these questions. Similar questions exist not only in our personal lives but in the academia, business and governments as well. The hunting ground for opinions on these questions used to be friends and family, acquaintances, consumer reports et cetera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But have you ever wondered how this scenario has turned out to be in the post web era? During the last decade, mining for public opinion has gotten a lot organized, thanks to the abundance of information in the web. This is what we call opinion mining, otherwise known as sentiment analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By definition sentiment analysis is the process of extraction and analysis of public opinion from any sort of source material using natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics. In essence, we try to get the subjective information from a document, usually written. This can help determining the attitude and emotional state of the author or speaker on some certain topic. The simplest task of sentiment analysis is finding out whether the text has a negative or positive attitude. It can even be translated to good or bad. A little more complex is to rank the attitude in a scale of 1 to 5. This gets way more complicated when emotional states like &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;angry&amp;rdquo; are added as parameters. Based on this analysis of sentiment can be classified in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Polarity or valence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emotional state or feelings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subjectivity or objectivity identification&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sentiment analysis draws ideas and techniques from statistics, natural language processing, machine learning and a few more. The massive amount of data found in the web is overwhelming if not sorted out. Statistics helps to get a count of words and sentence patterns to give a overview of the document&amp;rsquo;s polarity. Natural language processing techniques give more accuracy by breaking the sentences in to tokens with weights. Machine learning refine the result further more by learning from previously analyzed data and modifying the algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Natural language processing is breaking down sentences into a language&amp;rsquo;s bare basic components, nouns, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, punctuations etc. By breaking down a sentence we can understand how a sentence is formed, whether it has negated words or not etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of application of machine learning in sentiment analysis is the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM). This standard machine-learning technique is said to be the most accurate text classifier method. Naive Bayes classifier is another technique, a Bayes theorem based simple probabilistic classifier widely used in spam filtering, sorting emails, language detection and sentiment detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many examples of sentiment analysis in action in the internet. For example &lt;a href="http://sentdex.com/">Sentdex&lt;/a> goes through thousands of news articles, analyses words and brand names and provides infographics on the polarity of them.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Musings about friendship</title><link>/posts/2015-10-04-musings-about-friendship/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2015 00:46:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2015-10-04-musings-about-friendship/</guid><description>As I see it, you can make friends in only two ways: one is a emotional journey where all your personal firewalls break down and you almost know how the other person feels like.

It&amp;rsquo;s usually not and I am not claiming otherwise.</description><content>&lt;p>As I see it, you can make friends in only two ways: one is a emotional journey
where all your personal firewalls break down and you almost know how the other
person feels like. Another way is through gradually increasing appreciation for
someone where at a point you actually know what your friend is thinking. Now
hold a moment before saying that friendship can&amp;rsquo;t be this much black and white.
It&amp;rsquo;s usually not and I am not claiming otherwise. Ideally you can call a
relationship a friendship when these two sort of connections work together in a
complementary way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people don&amp;rsquo;t give that much thought about this because either your
connections with someone is complementary with each other and you are friends
with them, or not complementary at all hence you just don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;click.&amp;rdquo; With time
your friendship grows and the contribution of one of these two aspects rises and
other falls. If you observe carefully, you will see that you don&amp;rsquo;t talk with
your childhood friend now the same way you used to talk when you were a child.
This is because the most of the emotional pull has converted in to rational
understanding over time. It&amp;rsquo;s not like you don&amp;rsquo;t feel love for your friend, it&amp;rsquo;s
still there but you now think of them in terms of cause and effect. Sometimes
this change is perceived as being more &amp;ldquo;mature&amp;rdquo; whereas it&amp;rsquo;s only you being more
logical towards your companionship. Same goes for vice versa when you see people
defending their friends even though they did something really bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadness is, when you realize that your emotions and rationality don&amp;rsquo;t complement
each other in your relationships. That&amp;rsquo;s when you start losing ties with your
friend. Mostly it goes unnoticed, but the process is painful anyway.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Confessions of an impatient coder</title><link>/posts/2015-09-14-confessions-as-a-programmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 00:41:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2015-09-14-confessions-as-a-programmer/</guid><description>I am a very impatient person, and my attention span is short.

The reason behind this is you have already committed the files that you added to .gitignore and now git is tracking the files. Unless you delete them git will keep an eye on any changes on those files as it would do with any other. To get the new .gitignore rule registered with the repo you will have to manually remove tho file(s) from git&amp;rsquo;s cache. So here is what you need to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, YOU MUST COMMIT any staged progress, otherwise they will get lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you can go on to removing the problematic files from git&amp;rsquo;s tracking. For only one file, you will have to run this commad and that&amp;rsquo;s it. Git will smartly ignore whatever you tell it to ignore:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But in case you have way too many files to mention one by one, you might want to remove all the files at once. In this case git will stop tracking all files, so you will also have to add them once again manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">git rm -r --cached &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
git add .
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lastly, simply commit again:&lt;/p>

developed this habit of staying up at night a few years ago. I don’t really
remember how I got this habit, surely not from studying. I used to talk to
people on Facebook and other sites, especially foreigners who live in places
with 12 hours of time difference. After a while I realized I didn’t need more
than 4 hours of sleep a day. Well, that realization might be wrong but at that
time when the habit was sinking into my daily routine, it seemed ingenious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like to categorize myself as a different sort of hyperactive person.
There are people who think for a while then take a long time out before
actualizing their thoughts. Then there are other kind of people who like to rush
out to do something new as soon as the idea has acquired a form in their minds.
Sadly, I don’t belong to either of the types. I will come to the explanation of
my exact type after a flashback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was as school, someone once inspired me enough to lead me start writing
diary. I am forever indebted to that person for giving me my first diary, which
was just a small notebook. I was around the age of 13, and my vocabulary was
fairly limited, just enough to write small essays for school. I am not
particularly an observant person, which might be a reason why my book reading
habit didn’t contribute to my vocabulary as much as it should have at that time.
With my limited vocabulary of Bangla I used to write about incidents that were a
big deal for me. For example, I wrote an elaborate entry about one very stormy
evening. All the windows were open when the Kal Boishakhi storm struck, the door
to my room got stuck shut. I was so scared at that time, I had felt impelled to
write down the incident to dissipate my feelings. After this I kept diaries for
years, although with irregular entries, but&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s the term. Dissipating the feelings. If it were just a few years ago then
I wouldn’t have admitted it, but the fact is that I am an emotionally volatile
person. Actually I hadn’t known this before I had my first romantic encounter,
and eventually a bad break up. After a few months of my breaking up, I was brave
enough to look back at the memories. It was only then that I understood my
intense emotional nature can be a big hurdle in life. Interestingly, the
beginning of the relationship was exactly the same time when I stopped keeping
diaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s around 3:00AM now, and I am still wide awake. So what went wrong with my
good old way of life, when I had everything at least remotely in a framework?
Not just any framework, a routine that I had respect enough to follow every day.
What caused this total disregard for anything structurized?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a matter of fact, the answer is in my first love. At the time I met my first
love, I was fresh out of high school, waiting for admission tests, full of
energy but no place to exert it with full force. Even my parents hadn’t been
able to guide towards something constructive, other than studying of course.
Only, conventional way of studying never appealed to me. I had to experience
something in order to learn it, no matter how many books I read I just had to
try out whatever I had to learn. In the current context of Bangladeshi
education, this was as near as impossible as it could be. As a result, my
subconscious associated my relationship as a way of venting out my feelings, in
contrary to writing entries in a diary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a perfectly normal thing to happen in one’s life. Human relationships
are supposed to be media of emotion. All I did was switch to this medium, that’s
all. But the transition happened only one way, not the other way around. So
after that small episode in my small life time ended, I did not revert to a
different way to express myself. I had forgotten how to write for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will start writing once again, but not in the confinement of my personal
diary. I want my voice to be heard, because my voice in the herald of the forces
that drive me. I want to share my view and philosophy about life with people so
that I can understand myself a little better. I want to learn the art of
expressing one’s self.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
