Honestly I don't even know how many times I have had this conversation with myself. Each time I start working on a personal project after eons the following monologue goes on in my mind:

: Umm, this code looks weird and dirty, why did I even decide to do it like this?

: Oh god, this was going in a completely wrong direction

: Damn I got some major cleaning up to do!

: Am I sure I actually want to continue this?

: Mission abort: the project structure looks completely alien now!
