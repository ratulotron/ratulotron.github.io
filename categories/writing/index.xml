You might say that is the sound of your blood pulsating in your body, recycling carbon dioxide and bringing in new oxygen every now and then.
To me is is the sound of wind passing by us, as we fall through the eternal void. It is a reminder of that inevitable crash we all have to face when this brief flight we have been in since our birth ends and we stop moving forever.</description><content>&lt;p>If you cup your hands on both of your ears, you will hear a swishing sound that almost feels increases every few seconds. You might say that is the sound of your blood pulsating in your body, recycling carbon dioxide and bringing in new oxygen every now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me is is the sound of wind passing by us, as we fall through the eternal void. It is a reminder of that inevitable crash we all have to face when this brief flight we have been in since our birth ends and we stop moving forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you first realize this you can throw your arms outwards and cry in fear, you can try to clutch on to anything you can grab a hold of. Suddenly there is something in your extended fists! Another hand is clutching on to yours! The vibration of the wind rushing to meet you from below feel ecstatic almost. You were going to brace yourself for the entirety of this journey towards sure obliteration, but now you have someone to occupy your mind instead of those thoughts. Whenever you look right over your shoulder, there is that person smiling back at you like bright red petunia. You feel like it&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, may be this is what was meant to be, may be we were doomed to meet the ground with someone holding our hands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You look outwards and see the ones without a hand to grab on to. Something breaks inside you. The wind grows stronger, but you feel like you need to hold that person&amp;rsquo;s hands. You stretch out to them and surprisingly see the other hand, the hand that gave you the warmth in the first place loosens up a bit. You cannot ignore your instinct of flying towards the other body falling with all it&amp;rsquo;s weight centered in it&amp;rsquo;s heart. It&amp;rsquo;s a very heavy one indeed, and you feel like you need to lend some help to carry it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other body drops as if it&amp;rsquo;s bound to a rock, you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get a hold of it. Your heart bleeds each time you try to nudge yourself a bit towards it, but just want to give it some warmth, that&amp;rsquo;s all it needs, right? The warmth you got changed the fall for you, to you it&amp;rsquo;s not the fall that worries you anymore, you are more anxious how to fly in the sky rest of the way! You almost grab the other person by their collar. You close your eyes as you embrace them for one warm and fuzzy hug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wind grows colder. What is the end of this fall, anyway? Will it be a big splash? Or a thunderous kapoot! Will you remember the sound when it all ends and you are lying on the floor, looking up towards the gold-blue afternoon sky? You can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything with the anticipation of impending conjuncture. But oh? You wave your hands at nothing! You open your eyes and suddenly discover you have flown off far away. The heavy hearted one is still falling, you haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to give them the purpose to fly, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t show them the dream of the avian marvels of the prehistoric era. Instead you are so far away from those set of warm hands that gave you this newfound joy in meeting your crash, that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to get back to it. One single snowflake lands on your fingertip, the freeze starting to spread&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing you see before your eyes turn into crystal orbs of ice is those two pair of hands, the ones that held on to you when you were alone in despair. You have lost the amicable ardor that you were so fond of. You don&amp;rsquo;t hear the sound your body makes when it meets the concrete street and breaks into a thousand piece, you are gone way before.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Sentiment Analysis: An Intertwinement of Disciplines</title><link>/posts/2015-11-26-sentiment-analysis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2015 13:03:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2015-11-26-sentiment-analysis/</guid><description>How often do you get the urge to know what others think about you, that is, your actions and preferences?

No matter what the number is, you are not alone. Humans as individuals, have always been interested in knowing the opinion of the people around them. Should I talk to her? Is it a good idea to buy that car? Who should I vote? These are only the simplest examples of opinion related questions that arise in our minds every single day. Getting a nod from your best friend, a positive gesture from your dad or a better campaign slogan helps a lot to answer these questions. Similar questions exist not only in our personal lives but in the academia, business and governments as well. The hunting ground for opinions on these questions used to be friends and family, acquaintances, consumer reports et cetera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But have you ever wondered how this scenario has turned out to be in the post web era? During the last decade, mining for public opinion has gotten a lot organized, thanks to the abundance of information in the web. This is what we call opinion mining, otherwise known as sentiment analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By definition sentiment analysis is the process of extraction and analysis of public opinion from any sort of source material using natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics. In essence, we try to get the subjective information from a document, usually written. This can help determining the attitude and emotional state of the author or speaker on some certain topic. The simplest task of sentiment analysis is finding out whether the text has a negative or positive attitude. It can even be translated to good or bad. A little more complex is to rank the attitude in a scale of 1 to 5. This gets way more complicated when emotional states like &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;angry&amp;rdquo; are added as parameters. Based on this analysis of sentiment can be classified in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Polarity or valence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emotional state or feelings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subjectivity or objectivity identification&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sentiment analysis draws ideas and techniques from statistics, natural language processing, machine learning and a few more. The massive amount of data found in the web is overwhelming if not sorted out. Statistics helps to get a count of words and sentence patterns to give a overview of the document&amp;rsquo;s polarity. Natural language processing techniques give more accuracy by breaking the sentences in to tokens with weights. Machine learning refine the result further more by learning from previously analyzed data and modifying the algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Natural language processing is breaking down sentences into a language&amp;rsquo;s bare basic components, nouns, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, punctuations etc. By breaking down a sentence we can understand how a sentence is formed, whether it has negated words or not etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of application of machine learning in sentiment analysis is the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM). This standard machine-learning technique is said to be the most accurate text classifier method. Naive Bayes classifier is another technique, a Bayes theorem based simple probabilistic classifier widely used in spam filtering, sorting emails, language detection and sentiment detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many examples of sentiment analysis in action in the internet. For example &lt;a href="http://sentdex.com/">Sentdex&lt;/a> goes through thousands of news articles, analyses words and brand names and provides infographics on the polarity of them.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
